Patrick ZwierzynskiCOMP20 – LAB 4This repo contains the file to my portfolio website! To access the portfolio website, go to the address bar of your web browser and type in: “patzwi.github.io”. The portfolio webpage contains a home page (index files) which links to an “About Me” page (bio files) and a “View Resume” page (resume files). 1) The structure of each of the three pages have been implemented correctly along with their respected stylesheets. There does not exist anything that I was not properly able to implement.2) Worked on this alone.3) 4 hours were spent working on the project.
