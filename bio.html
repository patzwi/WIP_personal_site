        I'm currently a Junior at Tufts University studying Computer
        Engineering. Why Computer Engineering? I really
        enjoy studying both hardware and software design, but can't really
        choose between the two- so why not do both?

        I was born and raised in New York City. I currently live in Queens, but
        have spent most of my early life in Brooklyn. Even though I
        spend most of my time 200 miles away as a student at Tufts, I still
        call NYC "home".

        Believe it or not, even as an engineering student, I do find free
        time to relax. I LOVE soccer. I'll usually find time on the weekend
        to watch my favorite team (Bayern Munich) play. Apart from watching
        soccer, I like to spend my time hanging out with friends or going
        outside.
