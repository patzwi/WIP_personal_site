    <!-- Activities and Projects -->
    <h3> ACTIVITIES AND PROJECTS: </h3> <br/>
    <h4> Audio Morse Code Decoder</h4><p>, 2016<br/>
       Translates an audio Morse code recording into readable text
       (written in MATLAB). <br/>
    </p>
    <ul>
         <li> Use of an envelope extraction method to distinguish different
           audio Morse code signals.
         </li>
         <li> Created a GUI to all for easy user access and upload of an audio
            Morse code file.
         </li>
    </ul>

    <h4> Gerp Search</h4><p>, 2016<br/>
       Indexes and searches a specified sub-directory (and any further,
       nested subdirectories) of text-files for a specified query search term
       (written in C++). <br/>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Handled indexing and query searches of hundreds of written texts
          from the Gutenberg Project archive in a reasonable amount of time
          and space.
        </li>
        <li> Used Hash table data structure to efficiently store and access
          large amounts of data. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4> Vending Machine Prototype</h4><p>, 2017<br/>
       Small, functional vending machine constructed using digital logic design
       and integrated circuits. <br/>
    </p>
    <ul>
         <li> User inputs coins. Certain coin totals will trigger output
           sensors that mimick soda being dispensed, change being returned,
           and other functions of a vending machine.
         </li>
         <li> Physically implemented using various IC components, including
           monostable multivibrator, 4-bit counter, decoder, EPROM, D-type
           Flip-Flop, Shift Registers, and logic gates.
         </li>
         <li> Simulated using VHDL programming (structural and behavioral
           modeling).
         </li>
    </ul>
